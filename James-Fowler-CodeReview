The from is easy to read very understandable with what each button/textbox does.
There is no error message in the 'Search By Price' groupbox.
I tried to make this program crash anyway I could and was unsucessful. 
I think the only thing i would have added is a clear and close button just to round off the program.
You explained the text well in thorughout and i had an easy time following it.
Overall I enjoyed the program
