So the letter of the assignment calls for each of the steps to BEGIN the program by arranging the lists differently.
Instead of writting seperate programs for this, I made 5 buttons to adjust the ordering.
Buttons are for:
  on hand values ascending and descending,
  price ascending and descending,
  rest to order by product num.
The program loads by using "order by product number" as a default.

It looks awful but I wanted to leave in the "original" long form code so I could usr this as a reference in the future.
After talk to a couple of senior devs I know I was told that they prefered the longer for versions with "from" and "where"
The argument was made that whil this might increase "lines" of code it has better readability and require no or at least less extensive comments to understand.
I do agree with their thoughts on this, but also wanted to show were I understood Lambda.
This way if I get any of that wrong, or the commented code you can let me know?

I might go back at adjust some of the comments, but I think they explain enough about what the code's intent is.
I'm not sure if my comments should be so descriptive as to explain exactly how the code is finding a min/max value and ordering the list
or if that would be considered too much and a simple "finding values between min and max and ordering results by price ascending" is good enough.
